Problem Description:
Audience: Business owners looking to set up a new chinese resturnat in Washington DC.
In Washington DC, if someone is looking to open a Chinese restaurant, where would you recommend that they open it? 
Chinese food is a staple for alot of neighborhood, sometimes you see several on one block. 

Why would someone be interested/care?
As a new business, you would want to know about the area where you were looking to set up.
1. Is there to much competition? - for example the chinese resturants on that block all have amazing reviews - 
  which means bringing in new customers might be harder.
2. how many people frequent that area? You would want to make sure your area has enough foot traffic
3. What times of the week are most popular - this could help indicate the hours/days you should be open.

By looking at the data provided in Foursquare - the buisness owner could get a good idea if it is a good idea to invest
in a property in DC that sells chinese food to people.
