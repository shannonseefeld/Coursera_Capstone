Problem Description:

In Washington DC, if someone is looking to open a Chinese restaurant, where would you recommend that they open it? 
Chinese food is a staple for alot of neighborhood, sometimes you see several on one block. As a new business, you would want to know 
the competition in the area.
1. Is there to much competition? - for example the chinese resturants on that block all have amazing reviews - 
  which means bringing in new customers might be harder.
2. how many people frequent that area? You would want to make sure your area has enough foot traffic
