Data:
For this project I will be using the FourSquare API to look at the surrounding city for similar venues and foot traffic as well as a JSON 
geo file of washington DC in order to map out analytics using folium. 

Within the foursquare API i will be using the following endpoints.

Search: https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api/venues/search
  Using the search call I will be seeing what current venues are in the area of Washington DC
  For example if using the search query you see there are several chinese food establishments in the surrounding area
  you might want to look somewhere else. 
  
Trending: GET https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/trending
  To see if there is any trending chinese resturants in the area. If for exmple there are several chinese food places around but none 
  are trending that might indicate the food is not well liked which could be a way in for your new establishment. Or perhaps the trending food 
  in the area is Italian -that might indicate Chiense food might not be the best palce for the people in that neighborhood.
  
Likes: GET https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/VENUE_ID/likes
  See if any chinese food resturants got likes and how many. Going along with the trending. How many chinese places have a lot of likes
  or which ones dont have any likes. If there is a chinese establishjent with no likes then again might be agood place for your to set up 
  shop.
  
Simliar:GET https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/VENUE_ID/similar
  See if any resutarnts that are simliar to chinese are around. - ie: pan asian, Is there alot of foot traffic for asian cusine in the
  neighbrohood. 


I would also mabye like to pull in a Json geo file of Washington DC
 that could be used for mappings later.
